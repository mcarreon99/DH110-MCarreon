## DH110: User Experience and Design (Spring 2021)
##### In this project, I will be evaluting the design of the following web/apps: MyLab & Mastering and . This was conducted in reference to **Neilson's 10 Usability Heuristics**, and I hope to give suggestions to help improve and maximize the user's experience.

### Severity Ratings in Heuristic Evaluation - ([Ratings by Neilson Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/))
#### 1 - Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project
#### 2 - Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
#### 3 Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority

## Website 1: MyLab & Mastering (https://mlm.pearson.com/northamerica/index.html)

#### MyLab is a collection of online homework, tutorial, and assessment products designed to teach higher education students. It is basically a digital learning platform that offers interactive online courses and a personalized curriculum. It is somewhat similar to the more widely known platforms such as Coursera.org or Khanacademy.org. I chose this specific course provider as I had to use it for one of my classes this previous quarter, and I did not have the best experience with it. The main issues I experienced were accessibility and consistency errors, and the software is very nitpicky and not up-to-date. The visual design is plain and not very engaging and the overall website still has much to improve on.  However, this is not very surprising as there was a general consensus amongst my fellow classmates that the website had __many issues__.
