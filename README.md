## DH110: User Experience and Design (Spring 2021)
##### In this project, I will be evaluting the design of the following web/apps: MyLab & Mastering and . This was conducted in reference to **Neilson's 10 Usability Heuristics**, and I hope to give suggestions to help improve and maximize the user's experience.

## Website #1: MyLab & Mastering (https://mlm.pearson.com/northamerica/index.html)
#### MyLab is a collection of online homework, tutorial, and assessment products designed to teach higher education students. It is basically a digital learning platform that offers interactive online courses and a personalized curriculum. It is somewhat similar to the more widely known platforms such as Coursera.org or Khanacademy.org. I chose this specific course provider as I had to use it for one of my classes this previous quarter, and I did not have the best experience with it. However, this is not very surprising as there was a general consensus amongst my fellow classmates that the website had __many issues__.
